## Dependencies

All assets are pre-compiled for your viewing pleasure, however you will want to consider using these tools to get up and running with ease...

- Git
- NPM & NodeJS
- Grunt & Grunt CLI

## Installation

- Clone the repo and then cd into the project root directory.
- NPM install all the dependencies 
- Install Grunt CLI (npm install -g grunt-cli)
- Serve (see below)

## Serve

I've supplied a simple grunt http server. Simply run 'grunt serve' from project root in your terminal.

The app will run in your default browser at http://localhost:8008/#/ (ensure that no other service is using this port)
